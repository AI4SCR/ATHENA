    "\n",
    "The quantification of the diversity in an ecosystem or a community is a long-standing problem in ecology and, not surprisingly, a vast body of scientific literature has addressed the problem. The application of the concepts developed in ecology to cancer research is straightforward and there is a direct analogy between species/cell types and ecological niches/tumor micro-environments. In general, the metrics developed in ecology try to describe the number of species and their relative abundance within a ecosystem, weighting both aspects differently depending on the metric. The mathematical foundation of these metrics is rooted in information theory.\n",

    "### Spatial adaption\n",
    "To harness the spatial information about the tumor architecture we adjusted the computation of the diversity indices to consider the phenotype distributions of the single observations (cells). Diversity measures can be computed on a _global_ scope (top) or on a _local_ scope (bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "The _global_ scope simply uses the phenotype distribution of the sample and is not\n",
    "exploiting the spatial information in the data. The _global_ scope quantifies the diversity only a sample-level.\n",
    "This is how traditional diversity scores in ecology work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the _local_ scope exploits the graph representation to compute individual\n",
    "phenotype distributions for each single cell based on its neighborhood and enables a cell-level quantification of diversity.\n",
    "The resulting diversity score distribution can be aggregated / summarised to obtain a sample-level diversity score.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The result column indicates if the metric is computed on a global (sample) level or on a local (cell or spot) level. The input column specifies the input information used by the metrics. A metric that uses the phenotype distribution does not rely on spatial information. In contrast, metrics that require a graph input use the spatial information encoded in this data representation. Results of some methods depend on hyperparameter choices, as indicated by the last column. Every metric depends on the phenotyping process employed in the experimental setting.\n",
